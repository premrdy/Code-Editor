Code Editor Integrated with Time and Space Complexity Analysis Overview
Code Editor Integrated with Time and Space Complexity Analysis is a desktop application designed to enhance the coding experience by providing real-time feedback on time and space complexity for Java, Python, and C/C++ code. It combines advanced debugging tools, syntax highlighting, and real-time code execution into a single, user-friendly environment.

Features

Time and Space Complexity Analysis:

Analyze the computational complexity of algorithms in real-time.
Supports complexities like O(n), O(log n), O(n log n), and more, with explanations.
Language Support:

Write, run, and debug code in Java, Python, and C/C++.
Debugging Tools:

Step through code, set breakpoints, and inspect variable values during execution.
Real-Time Code Execution:

Compile and execute code with a single click using the Run button.
Syntax Highlighting:

Enhance readability and identify syntax errors with colored code syntax.
User-Friendly UI:

Tabs for multiple file support.
Console output for displaying runtime results or errors.
Line numbers displayed alongside the editor (similar to VSCode).

How to Use
Run the Application:

Compile and run the application using Java's Swing framework.
The main class is CodeEditor.
Write Your Code:

Select a language and start coding in the provided editor.
Analyze Complexity:

Click the Analyze button to get a detailed analysis of the code's time and space complexity.
Debug Your Code:

Set breakpoints, step through code, and inspect values for thorough debugging.
Execute Code:

Click the Run button to compile and execute the code directly.

Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK): Version 8 or above.
Python: (Optional, for Python code execution).
